# Final Project of ML Techniques
## Rules and Target
* Problem Description:

In this project, we are going to play with data from **Book-Crossing** dataset, which contains information of many user IDs, book descriptions and book ratings (integer value from 1 to 10). Instructor also provides the implicit book rating data (value 0) and hope you can make the best use of them if possible. Your goal is to predict the book rating, and you should notice that different tracks have different criteria. Besides the original Book-Crossing dataset, we additionally provide the external data crawled by TAs, which are the descriptions of some books (not all the books). Per course policy, you are **NOT allowed** to use any other data.
